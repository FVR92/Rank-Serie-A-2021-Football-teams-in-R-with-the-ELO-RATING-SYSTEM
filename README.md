ELO RATING SYSTEM

I have now been with my girlfriend for nearly 4 or 5 years…time flies wright? Well lately i have begun to notice some little hints regarding a possible wedding…so one evening, at dinner, i have decided to talk her about it, and yes, she wouldn’t mind getting married. Long story short, i opted for a litle bet: “I’ll marry you if my football(soccer) team will win this year italian league!!” I am a big AS Roma supporter, and my team has not won anything in decades…still, she agreed. So this is where this project started; i love my girlfriend, and I also love data science, so why should i not use a litle help? Here comes the ELO RATING SYSTEM, i’ll use it to rank the Serie A teams, and maybe calculate some probabilities for a couple of matches.
